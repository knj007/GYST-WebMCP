# GYST WebMCP

GYST is a human-owned daily and weekly ritual ledger. The application can read bounded context and help prepare drafts, while only the person can commit a record to the ledger.

## Current checkpoint

The reproducible application and provider foundation is complete and deployed from commit `b6ba3ea` on `main`:

- Production: <https://gyst-web-mcp.vercel.app>
- Next.js App Router routes: `/`, `/daily`, and `/weekly`
- Local Supabase: Postgres 17 with one tested remediation migration
- Hosted Supabase: migration history matches local and security advisors are clean
- Reminder Worker: local skeleton and successful Wrangler dry runs only

The deployed application is currently a static product shell. The application schema, authentication, RLS ownership policies, ritual forms, WebMCP tools, reminders, Turnstile, and Resend integration still need to be built.

## Local development

Requirements:

- Node.js 24.13.0 (`.nvmrc` pins the repository runtime)
- npm 11.8.0
- Docker Desktop
- Supabase CLI 2.116.0 or newer

If Docker is not available in an existing Windows process, prepend `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin` to that process's `PATH`.

Install dependencies and start the local services:

```bash
npm ci
supabase start --ignore-health-check
npm run dev
```

The application runs at <http://127.0.0.1:3000> and Supabase Studio at <http://127.0.0.1:54323>. Local Supabase analytics are intentionally disabled; the core database, Auth, API, Storage, Realtime, Studio, and test-mail services remain available.

The application shell does not require provider values. When integrations are added, copy `.env.example` to an ignored local environment file and supply values there. Never commit or print provider values.

Stop local Supabase when it is no longer needed:

```bash
supabase stop
```

## Verification

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run typecheck:worker
npm run test
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
npm run worker:dry-run
supabase db reset
supabase test db
supabase db lint
supabase migration list --local
```
